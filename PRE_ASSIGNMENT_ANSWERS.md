Which ML powered feature will you choose and why?
In my case I would like to add something related wiht sentiment analysis, because nowadays everything relasted wiht how the thing looks for the people is more important than how everything works behind the scenes.

What do you think are the greatest areas of risk in completing the project?
The time, because we have a lot of tasks to achieve and not everything is to easy and fast, I think only to create the scaffolding of the project in a good wat, I'm gonna spend around the half time, because if I have a good structure I can work better now and in the future.

What changes/additions would you make to the design?
I would like to know how many people type some repositores on the search bar and try to create a average about what are the most important codes. 

List two or three features that you would consider implementing in the future that would add significant value to the project.
1-Good structure into the project.
2-Try to fallow the best practices on the developing side.

Are there any clarifying questions you would ask? If you're able to make assumptions about these and continue, please record and share your assumptions
