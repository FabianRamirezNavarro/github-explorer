Describe the major design/build decisions and why you made them.
Try to have everything separated, the components, hooks, styles, pages, services, schemas, I like to work in this way because if I have to explain the code to a new developer is gonna be faster and easier because is to reliable and maintanable. 

How long did the assignment take (in hours)? Please break down your answer into buckets (e.g. "Learning Framework", "Coding", "Debugging").

Scaffolding(Structure or architecture project): 4 hours 

If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?

Try to do the same related with the good structure I implemented. 

Did you learn anything new?

Of course I learned about how implememted charts because so far I haven't had the opportunity to work on this. 

Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?

I think so, because I  did my best and learned new things, but maybe with more time than 8 hours I will complete more tasks or functionalities at 100%, I would like to complete the whole style like tha images you sent to me on the ppt, also added the remove button and of course detail the chart but I don't have more time(8 hours)

Are there any significant web development-related skills that you possess that were not demonstrated in this exercise? If so, what are they?
Databases, because I only consume an API
